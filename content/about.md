## The Websiteâ€™s Journey

This website began as a fun project for a group of five close friends. Over time, it turned into something useful for peers, so I decided to publish it. Iâ€™ve since polished its look and added helpful functionalities, making it a resource for everyone.

## Looking Ahead

This website will **always remain free**!  
As I believe in making learning resources accessible to everyone.

Some points about the future of this project:

- ðŸš€ The technology or UI might change as needed.
- ðŸŽ¨ Features will continue to evolve based on user feedback.
- ðŸ’¡ Suggestions are welcome! Fill out the form on the home page.

As the sole owner of this website, I make all decisionsâ€”but I value your input to make this platform even better.
