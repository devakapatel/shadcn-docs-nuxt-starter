# What is new in T9?

I am excited to announce the **biggest update to T9 yet!** This update brings a host of new features and improvements that will enhance your experience with the site. Here are some of the highlights:

::field{name="ðŸŒŸ Nextra 3 â†’ ShadCN Nuxt Docs"}
We have moved from [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) to [ShadCN Nuxt Docs](https://shadcn-docs-nuxt.vercel.app/) for this site. This change allows you to leverage the power of _ShadCN (Component Library)_ and _Nuxt 3 (VueJS Framework)_ and its ecosystem, providing a more seamless experience for readers.

::field{name="ðŸ”Ž Better Search Support"}
We have improved the search functionality of the site, in the previous version, the search component was making website unresponsive for several seconds, which has been fixed in this version.

::field{name="ðŸŽ¨ Custom Theme Selection"}
Custom colors are now available for the site, allowing you to choose a color that matches your personal preference. **_Check the brush icon on the top right corner of the page._** This feature is especially useful for those who want to create a unique and personalized experience for their their reading environment.
